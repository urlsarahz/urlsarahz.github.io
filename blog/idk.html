    <p style="font-size: 25px;" align="justify"><i>i don't know</i>? <i>maybe</i>? isn't a life of "perhaps" and wishy-washiness exhausting? it was for me. i had contorted myself into uncomfortable personalities, always trying to find the right situation to say/do the right words/actions. i closed myself off to the people who cared about me, in fear that my overtures would be rebuffed. but real love, real relationships can only bloom when you stop turning inward and instead, open yourself up. why do you shy away from loving someone fully, even if, in return, you are loved back just as much? so, give yourself permission to show everyone you chersih just how much you do; fill your time with the people and things you love. there is nothing more faithful to see and to let yourself be seen. but seeing, and loving, takes time <code>&#8212;</code> why not start now?</p>
