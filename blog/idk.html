    <p style="font-size: 25px;"><i>i don't know</i>? <i>maybe</i>? isn't a life of "perhaps" and wishy-washiness exhausting? it is for me. always trying to find the right words/actions and the right situation to say/act on them closed me off to the people who loved me. i contemplated change for too long, fearing to reach out to others and paralyzing myself. but real love, real relationships can only bloom when you stop turning inward and instead, open yourself up. why do you shy away from loving someone fully, even if, in return, you are loved back just as much? give yourself permission to tell everyone you care about the extent of which you do and to fill your time with the people and things you love. there is nothing more faithful to see and to let yourself be seen. but seeing, and loving, takes time, so why not start now?</p>
    <!-- <p>i'm still learning to cater to myself, still finding the courage to mold myself into <i>me</i>.</p> -->
